        JavaScript files you'd normally include here should instead be loaded by
        requirejs,   do not add `<script src="some-file.js"></script>` tags to
        this file lest   you want to lose hours of your life debugging(this is
        especially  important when deploying)

         Instead, this project uses requirejs:
         - During development, your-app/require-config.js is used in conjunction with
           your-app/js/main.js to bootstrap your application and the module
           dependency chain.
         - During testing, your-app/test/main.js and your-app/test/main.karma.js are
           also used to configure requirejs with your test files before booting
           your application in your-app/js/main.js
         - To deploy your application run `grunt production` from your terminal.
           This task will read the same your-app/require-config.js and your-app/js/main.js
           configuration files used during development and furthermore pre-process
           coffeescript files you've required using the cs!./someModule syntax
    -->

    <script>
      var require = {
        baseUrl: '../js'
      }
    </script>

    <script data-main="../require-config" src="../bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>
  </body>
